# Watermarking Images

The motivation for watermarking images arises from the increasing use of generative AI models, which often create new images based on training or input data that may be protected by copyright.

## Process Overview
1. Embedding invisible watermarks into images
2. Searching for images with potential similarities
3. Detecting invisible watermarks in other images

### 1. Embedding
To embed invisible watermarks effectively, the image is partitioned into blocks. This approach enhances the likelihood of detecting a sufficient number of intact blocks even after transformations such as rotation or cropping. Since the watermarking of each block is independent, the process is highly parallelizable. Additionally, many of the operations involved are matrix-based and can benefit from GPU acceleration.

Two critical constraints must be satisfied:
- **Invisibility:** The watermark must not be perceptible to the human eye.
- **Robustness:** The watermark must withstand common image transformations.

#### 1.1. Extracting the Y-Channel
Since changes in the RGB Color Channels would directly affect the percepted image, we will focus on YCrCb. Especially the Y-Channel ([Luma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_(video))), which contains the brightness information.

#### 1.2. Transforming into Frequency-Domain
Embedding masks into the frequencies of the image is only working in the [Frequency-Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain). Therefore we apply the Fast Fourier Transform ([FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform)) and extract the magnitude and phase information.

#### 1.3. Generating and applying Watermark
For our watermarking we assume that each image itself is a secret and an unique secret is generated. Both should never be shared. The key mask is generated by combining the unique secret and the mean of the given image. These will be hashed by a hash function (e.g. sha256) and used as a seed for a random number generator. This generator can be used for generating the key mask with values between zero and one. To ensure the watermark is only applied to mid-frequecies ("interesting" frequencies), we apply a frequency-mask.

The watermark is than applied to the magnitude and used to construct the spectrum with the phase.

#### 1.4. Reconstructing the Image
With the spectrum we are able to perform an inverse fast fourier transform and create the watermarked Y-Channel. Combining it with the original Cr- and Cb-Channel results in the watermarked image.

As shown below, the original and watermarked image visibly don't differ. Only if we multiply the difference by a factor of 10, the watermark becomes visible.

### 3. Detection
Detecting watermarks in images is computationally intensive, particularly because the original image may have undergone various transformations. However, since time constraints are not a critical factor, an effective approach involves first identifying the block frequency. Once the block frequency is determined, the detection process can treat each block as an independent job. By statistically evaluating the number of detected blocks, it becomes possible to assess whether a watermark is present. In the worst-case scenario, all potential blocks must be examined until a statistically significant detection threshold is reached.

#### 3.1. Transforming the Image
The watermarked image will go through some kind of transformation. The following example shows:
- OpenCV: ROTATE_90_CLOCKWISE
- OpenCV: MEDIAN_BLUR_3

#### 3.2. Correlating the Frequency-Domain
The tranformed image needs to be translated into the frequency domain via FFT. Even though we tranformed the watermarked image, the correlation is still high enough to assume the watermark has been detected.
