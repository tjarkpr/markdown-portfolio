## Abstract

This article presents a theory for fostering innovation and creating new use-cases of technology by bridging the gap between **technology experts** and **domain experts**. It introduces a three-step process — **seeding**, **growing**, and **harvesting** — that connects, supports, and scales collaboration among these groups to solve real-world problems with technology.

## Motivation

In working with colleagues from various companies and divisions, I’ve seen firsthand how sharing insights and building networks across technical and non-technical roles can elevate **data literacy** and **innovation**.

We came from diverse backgrounds — some with strong technical skills, others with deep domain expertise. I quickly realized that innovation isn’t a solo act. It’s a **collective process** of identifying use-cases, understanding complex challenges, and co-creating solutions.

This experience led to the development of the following theory.

## Theory: The Seeding–Growing–Harvesting Model

Innovation and new use-cases of technology often emerge when two key groups collaborate:

- **Technology Experts**: Skilled in specific technologies or stacks, capable of delivering business value through digital tools.
- **Domain Experts**: Deeply knowledgeable about business sectors (like finance, healthcare, education) and the real-world problems that need solving.

To bridge these groups, I propose a **three-stage model**:

### 1. Seeding  
- Connect interest groups  
- Offer learning opportunities and experimentation grants  
- Foster a culture of curiosity and innovation  

### 2. Growing  
- Support collaborative research and prototyping  
- Enable hypothesis testing and pilot solutions  
- Promote shared ownership of outcomes  

### 3. Harvesting  
- Scale successful prototypes into production  
- Institutionalize continuous improvement  
- Share knowledge and celebrate learnings  

By applying this framework, organizations can cultivate a learning culture and unlock higher levels of creative potential.

## Conditions for Fostering Innovation

For this approach to thrive, companies should:

- **Encourage open collaboration** by allowing employees time to interact and form interest-based groups.  
- **Provide resources and flexibility** to support ideation and experimentation.  
- **Adopt effective change management** to help identify emerging technologies and inspire employee engagement.  

> Innovation often leads to more innovation — a **domino effect** of creativity and progress.
